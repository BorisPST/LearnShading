# Shadow Placement
- Shadow is placed on the bottom half of the sphere.
- Shape of the shadow curves upward like a crescent or smile.
- Shadow has a clean, hard edge (no gradient).
- The upper part of the sphere remains fully lit.

# Highlight Placement
- A solid, bright highlight sits near the top center of the sphere.
- The highlight shape is a rounded oval or bean.
- It's slightly off-center to feel more natural.
- No soft transitionâ€”clearly separated from the base color.

# Cast Shadow (optional)
- A flat elliptical shadow is placed directly beneath the sphere.
- Darker than the shadow on the sphere itself.
- Helps visually anchor the object to a surface.
